# Swift Weather App

Followed the YouTube tutorial "Create a weather app from scratch with this SwiftUI Crash Course" by Design Code.

I followed this tutorial to learn how to collect the users current longitude and latitude coordinates using Swift. 
This project also gave me insight into using API's and personal keys when collecting the current Weather Data at a certain location.
